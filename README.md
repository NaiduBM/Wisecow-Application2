## Features

- üêÑ ASCII cow art display
- üîí Secure TLS communication
- ‚ö° Load balanced deployment
- üöÄ Automated CI/CD pipeline
- üéØ High availability with multiple replicas

## Tech Stack


# System Monitoring Tools

This repository contains two system monitoring scripts implemented in Python:

1. System Health Monitor
2. Application Health Checker

## System Health Monitor

A Python script that monitors various system metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, and running processes. The script alerts when system resources exceed predefined thresholds.

### Features:
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Process monitoring
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Console-based alerts

### Usage:
```bash
python system_monitor.py
```

## Application Health Checker

A script that monitors application uptime and health by checking HTTP status codes. It determines if an application is functioning correctly by making HTTP requests to specified endpoints.

### Features:
- HTTP status code checking
- Uptime monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Support for multiple endpoints
- Simple status reporting (UP/DOWN)

### Usage:
```bash
python app_health_checker.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - psutil (for system monitoring)
  - requests (for HTTP requests)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install psutil requests
```

## Configuration

Both scripts can be configured by modifying their respective configuration sections:

### System Monitor Thresholds:
- CPU Usage: 80%
- Memory Usage: 90%
- Alert Interval: 60 seconds

### Health Checker Settings:
- Request Timeout: 30 seconds
- Check Interval: 5 minutes
- Retry Attempts: 3

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed through GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch. The pipeline:

1. Builds the Docker image
2. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
3. Deploys to Kubernetes

### Manual Deployment

If needed, you can deploy manually:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

## Architecture

- **Deployment**: 3 replicas for high availability
- **Service**: LoadBalancer type for traffic distribution
- **Ingress**: TLS-enabled access through wisecow.example.com
- **Resources**: CPU and memory limits configured for optimal performance

## Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)

## Infrastructure Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster with cert-manager
- DNS configuration for the domain
- GitHub Container Registry access
